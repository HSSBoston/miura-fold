# Origami crease pattern for the Miura fold

This is a [Squeak Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/) implementation of a simple algorithm to generate an origami crease pattern (folding diagram) for the [Miura fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miura_fold). The Miura fold is a method to (1) fold a sheet of paper into a smaller area by pushing the paper's diagonally opposite ends in one motion and (2) unpack the folded paper in one motion by pulling on its opposite ends.

The crease patterns of the Miura fold form a tessellation of parallelograms.

This code base is pushed to GitHub with Squeak's Git Browser ([Squot](https://github.com/hpi-swa/Squot)). The GeoBot class is implemented by customizing a class that is covered in Stephane Ducasse's awesome book ["Squeak: Learn Programming with Robots (Technology in Action) 1st Corrected ed., Corr. 2nd printing Edition"](https://smile.amazon.com/Squeak-Programming-Robots-Technology-Action/dp/1590594916/).




I wrote this code in August 2019 to work on a summer research project about the Miura fold. See a research summary report and a [poster presentation](images/poster.jpg), both written in Japanese, if you can read Japanese.

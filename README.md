# Origami crease pattern for the Miura fold

This is a [Squeak Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/) implementation of a simple algorithm to generate an origami crease pattern (folding diagram) for the [Miura fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miura_fold). The Miura fold is a method to (1) fold a sheet of paper into a smaller area by pushing the paper's diagonally opposite ends in one motion and (2) unpack the folded paper in one motion by pulling on its opposite ends. The crease patterns of the Miura fold form a tessellation of parallelograms.
